## Role Overview
Lngo users represent local NGO partners. They mainly review assigned scorecards, share updates or evidence from the field, and collaborate with Program Admins and Staff on follow-up actions.

## Logging In
1. Open the application URL and select **Log in**.
2. Enter your email and password; use **Sign in with Google** only if it is enabled for your account.

3. If you have not received credentials, request access from a Program Admin or System Admin.
4. Use **Forgot your password?** to reset credentials.

## Navigating the Dashboard
- The dashboard lists the programs and batches linked to your Local NGO.
- Quick links lead to **Scorecards**, **Notifications**, and **Downloads** (for PDFs or reference files).
- A filter bar helps you narrow scorecards by status (e.g., Submitted, Approved).

## Primary Tasks and Workflows

### Review Assigned Programs and Batches
1. From the dashboard, open a program to see active batches.
2. Select a batch to view scorecards relevant to your Local NGO or catchment area.
3. Open a scorecard to read ratings, issues raised, and action plans.

### Provide Updates and Supporting Documents
1. In a scorecard, use the comments or notes area to add clarifications or field updates.
2. Upload supporting documents (photos, reports) that demonstrate progress on action plans.
3. Save your changes; if a submission step is required, click **Submit** or **Update** as prompted.

### Coordinate with Program Teams
1. Respond to **Notifications** from Program Admins or Staff about missing information or follow-up actions.
2. If an action item is completed, comment with the completion date and attach evidence.
3. For schedule or access issues, message the Program Admin directly so they can adjust assignments.

## Tips, Best Practices, and Troubleshooting
- Keep uploads concise (smaller files upload faster on slow connections).
- Check the status column before making edits; avoid changing **Approved** scorecards unless requested.
- If you cannot see your batches, confirm with the Program Admin that your Local NGO is correctly linked.
- For login problems, reset your password and ensure your account is active; contact the Program Admin if access remains blocked.
- When adding updates, use clear dates and locations so Program Admins can verify progress quickly.
