### Submit Scorecards for Review
1. Save your work frequently using **Save Draft**.
2. When the session is complete, review all ratings and action items.
3. Click **Submit** to send the scorecard to your Program Admin. The status changes to **Submitted**.
4. If you notice mistakes after submission, use **Request Changes** or inform the Program Admin to reopen the record.

### Track Feedback and Actions
1. Check the **Notifications** panel for comments or change requests.
2. Open the scorecard to see requested edits; update fields and resubmit.
3. Once approved, download the PDF for field sharing if needed.

## Tips, Best Practices, and Troubleshooting
- Work in one browser tab per scorecard to avoid losing changes.
- When offline, keep notes separately and enter them once connected; ensure the session is saved as Draft before closing the browser.
- Use clear, concise descriptions for issues and action items to help approvers.
- If you cannot find your batch or facility, verify you are in the correct program and ask a Program Admin to check your assignment.
- For login issues, reset your password or contact your Program Admin to confirm your account is active.
- If file uploads fail, reduce file size and retry after a stable connection.
