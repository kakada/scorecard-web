3. If prompted, confirm your email via the link sent to your inbox.
4. Use **Forgot your password?** if you need to reset your credentials.

## Navigating the Dashboard
- The dashboard highlights the program assigned to you. The top navigation shows program tools such as Scorecards, CAF/Scorecard Batches, Templates, Facilities, Indicators, and Reports (availability depends on your configuration).
- A shortcuts panel may include links to **New Scorecard**, **New Batch**, or **Notifications**.
- The profile menu lets you switch language, update your password, or sign out.

## Primary Tasks and Workflows

### Review Program Setup
1. Go to **Programs** and open your program.
2. Verify the basic details, languages, facilities, indicators, rating scales, and PDF templates.
3. If settings look incorrect, coordinate with the System Admin to adjust shared references or rerun cloning.

### Manage Team Members
1. Open **Users** and filter by your program.
2. Add new Staff/Officer users with the correct program selected. If a Local NGO is involved, confirm the **Lngo** users are attached to the right partner.
3. Edit users to reset passwords, unlock accounts, or archive accounts that no longer need access.
4. Use the role badges to confirm permissions before assigning tasks.

### Plan and Track Scorecard Cycles
1. Create or open a **Scorecard Batch** or **CAF Batch** to group upcoming assessments.
2. Assign facilitators (Staff/Officer) and set key dates for community meetings, validation, and dissemination.
3. For each community or facility:
   - Click **New Scorecard**.
   - Select the facility, indicators, and rating scale.
   - Save to generate a draft.
4. Monitor progress in the batch list (e.g., Draft, In Progress, Submitted, Approved).

### Approve Data and Exports
1. Open a submitted scorecard and review ratings, issues raised, and action plans.
2. Use **Request Changes** if corrections are needed, or approve to finalize.
3. Generate PDFs using the assigned template; download or share with partners.
4. If notifications are configured, send updates to Staff or Lngo contacts.

## Tips, Best Practices, and Troubleshooting
- Keep your team list up to date; deactivate accounts quickly when staff leave.
- Reuse templates and indicators to keep reporting consistent across cycles.
- When a staff member cannot see a facility or indicator, confirm the program and batch selection.
- For login issues, ask a System Admin to confirm the account status or unlock it.
- Before approving a scorecard, double-check action plans and dates, as edits after approval may be restricted.
- If a PDF fails to generate, retry after a few minutes; if it persists, confirm the template file with a System Admin.
